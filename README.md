# Depreciation notice
IBM acquired AlchemyAPI in 2015 and merged it's services with IBM Watson in 2017.  
Watson and IBM provide:
- [An API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/)
- [A dotnet core nuget](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/dotnet-standard-sdk)
- [A GitHub repo](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IBM.WatsonDeveloperCloud/)

This repository and nuget package are now deprecated and not maintained anymore.  
Thanks to those who used the package, now is time to upgrade to Watson.
